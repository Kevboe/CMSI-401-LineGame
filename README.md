# LineGame
#### CMSI 401 repository for the LineGame Project
When installing and playing LineGame, make sure to have the react-native-svg package installed. If you do not have it installed you can get in by executing the command (with expo) 'expo install react-native-svg' or (with npm) 'yarn add react-native-svg'. Once the library is installed, you can run the app like any other expo project. Note that currently this have been developed for iOS, while it might run on android or the web, we cannot promise the same experience or consistency as we can for iOS.

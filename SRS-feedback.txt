LineGame Project SRS Feedback
==============================

Damn, you guys.... this is literally one of the best SRS submissions I've seen.

I don't see anything you need to do, other than as your development proceeds,
you will need to make sure you update the SRS to reflect anything that changes,
so that the end document reflects the "as-built" condition of the project.

AWESOME WORK!!

Initial submission 8% out of 8%, plus 2% out of 2% for the Gantt chart.
      10% out of 10% = 100% which is an A-plus

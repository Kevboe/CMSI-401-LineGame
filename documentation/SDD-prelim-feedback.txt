Very nice work on this document!  You have captured the architecture quite
well and it's easy to see what the parts of the application are and how then
fit together.

Just a couple of observations:

Your "activity" diagram is a cross between an activity and a sequence diagram
which is most interesting!  Because it isn't either, you should find a new
name for it, something like "flow of operations".

The "use case" diagram isn't that, either.  It DOES, however, show the data
flow, and could be easily re-made into a "state" diagram [by making the ovals
into round-corner boxes with gerund names and moving the names to the lines]
or re-labeled to something similar to "application task interactions".

Other than that, you did a great job!!

you got 10% out of 10% for this deliverable which is an A-plus.
